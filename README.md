CarbonZero is an enterprise-grade Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliance and predictive analytics engine. Engineered specifically for SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises), it digitizes the GHG Protocol to track Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions while utilizing autonomous AI agents to ensure international regulatory compliance (e.g., EU CBAM).

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 📊 GHG Protocol Physics Engine
* **Strict Regional Math:** Calculates carbon footprints using geofenced, IPCC/DEFRA-compliant emission factors.
* **Scope Isolation:** Automatically categorizes entries into Scope 1 (Direct), Scope 2 (Purchased Electricity), and Scope 3 (Value Chain).
* **Custom PPAs:** Supports enterprise Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with self-verified custom grid overrides.

### 🧠 Autonomous AI Advisory (Llama-3)
* **Context Compression:** Dynamically compresses massive Pandas DataFrames to bypass LLM token limits without losing mathematical accuracy.
* **Regulation Radar:** Cross-references facility locations and export markets against emerging carbon border taxes (e.g., EU CBAM, US frameworks).
* **Optimization Strategy:** Generates real-time CapEx/OpEx operational optimization and verified offset recommendations.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Data Integrity
* **Cryptographic Ingestion:** Uses MD5 row-hashing during bulk CSV uploads to detect and block duplicate data corruption.
* **Zero-Ghost Data:** Server-side validation actively blocks `0.0` quantity logging to prevent artificial deflation of annual run-rate projections.
* **Surgical Range Delete:** Destructive database actions are protected by explicit user verification protocols.

### 📑 Executive Reporting
* **Memory-Safe Architecture:** Bypasses raw-row rendering limits by synthesizing data via `FPDF` into high-level, 1-page executive PDF summaries.
* **Ternary Analytics:** Maps energy transition trajectories (Clean vs. Grid vs. Fossil) using complex Plotly ternary scatter charts.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

CarbonZero utilizes Streamlit's native multi-page architecture to isolate memory and ensure zero-latency routing.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greenops.git
cd greenops
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using **uv** (recommended):

```bash
uv sync
```

Or using standard **pip**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies include:** `streamlit`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `python-dotenv`, `fpdf2`, `crewai[litellm]`, `uuid`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key for the AI engine:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Boot the Application

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

## 🗄️ Database Structure

Local persistence utilizes flat JSON files mapped to Pandas DataFrames for rapid SME deployment.
